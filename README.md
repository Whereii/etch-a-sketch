# etch-a-sketch
This project probably took the most time out of everything I have worked on so far. It took a lot of figuring out when it came to the hover feature simply due to finding the syntax for using the current object you are hovering over in a different function was very difficult. Also, the flexbox and js code that I used for the resizing feature of the grid took a little bit of thinking before I had it figured out. For the initial question, simply type a number under 100.
